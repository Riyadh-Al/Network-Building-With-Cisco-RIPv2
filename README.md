<h2>Description</h2>
This project features a virtual network simulation of three Cisco 3600 series routers using GNS3, a free and robust network simulation tool. The network is configured with Ciscoâ€™s proprietary Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2) to demonstrate efficient routing operations. Each router is also equipped with a loopback address to enhance network reliability and stability. This setup highlights advanced network configuration techniques and the practical application of dynamic routing protocols in an educational and demonstration context.
<br />

<h2>Objectives</h2> 

- <b>Demonstrate the configuration and functionality of the Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2).</b>
- <b>Illustrate the setup of virtual loopback interfaces to ensure stable routing through the network.</b>
- <b>Show competence in network simulation and configuration using GNS3.</b>


<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

- <b>GNS3: Network simulation software used to virtualize the network.<b/>
- <b>Cisco 3600 Series Router Images: Required for simulating the specific Cisco router configurations.<b/>
- <b>RIPv2 Configuration: Dynamic routing protocol setup on all routers.</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>

<br />
Click the bottom left box with the red x such as in the image below and connect each router to the other using the FastEthernet. Once all routers are connected start the devices by hitting the green play button on the top.

<br />
<br />
Once all of the devices are on and running indicated by the green dots on the wires connecting the routers, click Consol connect to all devices as in the image below.

<br />
This is how the network output should look after entering the show IP interface brief command for each router.
