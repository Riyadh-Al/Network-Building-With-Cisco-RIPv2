# Network-Building-With-Cisco-RIPv2

 ### [YouTube Demonstration]

<h2>Description</h2>
This project features a virtual network simulation of three Cisco 3600 series routers using GNS3, a free and robust network simulation tool. The network is configured with Ciscoâ€™s proprietary Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2) to demonstrate efficient routing operations. Each router is also equipped with a loopback address to enhance network reliability and stability. This setup highlights advanced network configuration techniques and the practical application of dynamic routing protocols in an educational and demonstration context.
<br />

<h2>Objectives</h2> 

- <b>Demonstrate the configuration and functionality of the Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIPv2).</b>
- <b>Illustrate the setup of virtual loopback interfaces to ensure stable routing through the network.</b>
- <b>Show competence in network simulation and configuration using GNS3.</b>


<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

- <b>GNS3: Network simulation software used to virtualize the network.<b/>
- <b>Cisco 3600 Series Router Images: Required for simulating the specific Cisco router configurations.<b/>
- <b>RIPv2 Configuration: Dynamic routing protocol setup on all routers.</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>
